 HISTORY&#xD;
         This data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by&#xD;
         JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd.&#xD;
         The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing&#xD;
         3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of&#xD;
         shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects.&#xD;
         Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes&#xD;
         of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a class-&#xD;
         ification rule tree by means of computer induction.&#xD;
          This object recognition strategy was successfully used to &#xD;
         discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses&#xD;
         viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.&#xD;
          The rule tree classification performance compared favourably&#xD;
         to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neigh-&#xD;
         bour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and&#xD;
         computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees&#xD;
         generated by example indicated that the tree structure was &#xD;
         heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped&#xD;
         similar object views into single decisions.&#xD;
 &#xD;
 DESCRIPTION&#xD;
          The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS&#xD;
         (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which &#xD;
         extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising&#xD;
         both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance,&#xD;
         skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic&#xD;
         measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and&#xD;
         compactness.&#xD;
          Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment:&#xD;
         a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400.&#xD;
         This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the &#xD;
         expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would&#xD;
         be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to&#xD;
         distinguish between the cars.&#xD;
          The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the&#xD;
         model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees&#xD;
         to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse&#xD;
         backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black&#xD;
         to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000&#xD;
         framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with&#xD;
         a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels.&#xD;
         These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes,&#xD;
         negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and&#xD;
         thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to&#xD;
         remove "salt and pepper" image noise.&#xD;
          The vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured&#xD;
         using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees&#xD;
         corresponded to "head on" and "rear" views respectively while 90 and&#xD;
         270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of&#xD;
         60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured&#xD;
         for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between &#xD;
         images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.&#xD;
          A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera &#xD;
         at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets&#xD;
         also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains&#xD;
         only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image&#xD;
         at some orientations.&#xD;

         area of hollows= area of bounding poly-area of object &#xD;
         &#xD;
          The area of the bounding polygon is found as a side result of&#xD;
         the computation to find the maximum length. Each individual&#xD;
         length computation yields a pair of calipers to the object&#xD;
         orientated at every 5 degrees. The object is propagated into&#xD;
         an image containing the union of these calipers to obtain an&#xD;
         image of the bounding polygon. &#xD;
